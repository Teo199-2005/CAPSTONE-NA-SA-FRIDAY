# Teacher Edit Fix Summary

## Problem
The teacher edit functionality was showing "Teacher not found" error due to several mismatches between the code and database schema.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Field Name Mismatches**: The code was using field names that didn't exist in the database:
   - `license_number` (doesn't exist in database)
   - `hire_date` (should be `date_hired`)

2. **Employment Status Values**: The code was using different enum values than what's defined in the database:
   - Code used: `active`, `inactive`, `on_leave`
   - Database has: `active`, `inactive`, `resigned`, `terminated`

3. **Model Configuration**: The TeacherModel's `allowedFields` array didn't include all necessary fields.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated TeacherModel.php
- Fixed `allowedFields` array to include `teacher_id` and `date_hired`
- Removed non-existent `employee_id` and `hire_date`
- Updated validation rules to match database schema

### 2. Updated Teachers Controller (Admin/Teachers.php)
- Changed all instances of `hire_date` to `date_hired`
- Updated employment status validation from `on_leave` to `resigned,terminated`
- Fixed field references in both create and update methods
- Removed search by `license_number` (field doesn't exist)

### 3. Updated Teacher Edit Form (teacher_edit_form.php)
- Replaced `license_number` field with `teacher_id` field (read-only)
- Changed `hire_date` to `date_hired`
- Updated employment status options to match database enum values
- Added `resigned` and `terminated` options, removed `on_leave`

### 4. Updated Teachers List View (teachers.php)
- Changed table header from "License Number" to "Teacher ID"
- Updated display to show `teacher_id` instead of `license_number`
- Updated search placeholder text

### 5. Updated Teacher Details Modal (teacher_details_modal.php)
- Changed "License Number" to "Teacher ID"
- Updated field reference from `license_number` to `teacher_id`
- Changed "Hire Date" to "Date Hired"
- Updated field reference from `hire_date` to `date_hired`
- Added CSS styles for new employment status values

## Database Schema Reference
Based on `database_setup.sql`, the teachers table has these fields:
- `teacher_id` (varchar, unique)
- `date_hired` (date)
- `employment_status` (enum: 'active','inactive','resigned','terminated')
- No `license_number` field exists

## Testing
Run `test_teacher_fix.php` to verify the fixes work correctly. This script will:
1. Check existing teachers in the database
2. Create a test teacher if none exist
3. Test the problematic JOIN query that was causing the "Teacher not found" error

## Result
The teacher edit functionality should now work correctly without the "Teacher not found" error.
